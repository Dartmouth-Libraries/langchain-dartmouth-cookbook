# Getting started

To get started with the examples in this cookbook, you need Python (at least version 3.10) and a code editor installed on your system. Check out our [helpful research guide](https://researchguides.dartmouth.edu/c.php?g=1313588&p=9658071)!

Once you have Python installed, you can install `langchain_dartmouth` by running this command in your terminal:

```
pip install langchain_dartmouth
```

You should now be able to run any of the example notebooks on your system.
