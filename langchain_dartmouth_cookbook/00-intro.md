# Welcome to the `langchain_dartmouth` Cookbook

This is a collection of examples and tutorials of how to use the `langchain_dartmouth` library to build applications on AI models deployed in the Dartmouth Cloud.

`langchain_dartmouth` exists to facilitate the integration of Dartmouth-hosted models with the larger `LangChain` ecosystem. This lets you seamlessly build applications and processing pipelines, leveraging the vast catalog of components available through `LangChain` and its extensions, like vector stores, output processors, prompt templates, and more!

```{note}
If you want to dig deeper into the library, check out the [API reference](https://dartmouth-libraries.github.io/langchain-dartmouth/) or the [source code](https://github.com/Dartmouth-Libraries/langchain-dartmouth)!
```

While all examples in this Cookbook are written with novice `LangChain` users in mind, we recommend reading over the [Introduction to LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/introduction/) to gain a basic understanding of how `LangChain` works before diving into the examples below!
